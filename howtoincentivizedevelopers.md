At a very basic level, software developers respond to the following incentives :

* Autonomy
* Mastery
* Purpose/Passion

It is very important to tick all these boxes to incentivize programmers to join you on a project. 
Autonomy means avoiding micro-management and letting programmers find solutions. 
A good way to guarantee this is to avoid specifying every feature early on in the project. 
Mastery means providing your programmers with tough problems to work on. 
Most importantly, passion requires an alignment between the goals of your company and your programmerâ€™s passion. 
If these three requirements are met, programmers are much more likely to stick with your project.

In terms of compensation, one should be wary of fixed bid contracts. It creates a number of problems including:

* higher prices reflecting built-in insurance to have software built by date requested
* an incentive for programmers to build the software you need rather than the software you want
* lost time arguing about requirement vs. actually coding
* a misalignment of incentives in terms of implementing proposed improvements
* longer cycle time
* Good, experienced developers tend not to accept this form of payment, so if you do land such a contract, you've likely hired a bad or inexperienced team

Ways to get around include: 

* Provide a bonus if certain milestones are hit 
* Agree to an hourly price and have any hour beyond deadline billed at a lower price
* Remember to build contingency and flexibility in budget to achieve the desired level of fidelity

When agreeing to hourly price, it is important to remember that hiring someone who asks for a lower price will probably produce much lower quality work much slower than someone who charge a higher price. Depending on the fidelty required, it is usually better to hire the higher price as it will save time and money in the long run.
