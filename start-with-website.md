When developing software, it is generally a good idea to start with a website.  
Compared to starting with a mobile app, this approach has several advantages:
* Websites are easier and cheaper to build 
* Doing so allows flexibility to tinker with assumptions until the business model has been sufficiently validated
* It does not restrict your user base to mobile-only or to a particular device platform (e.g., Android or iOS)

In developing a website, it is important to consider users’ preferred devices for the offered functionality.  
A good rule of thumb is to consider “lean in” versus “lean back” use cases.  For example, if an application 
will require a high degree of user input through text fields (i.e., lean in), it likely makes sense to 
prioritize the development of a desktop-friendly website.  However, if the application merely outputs 
information (i.e., lean back), it will be beneficial to prioritize the development of a mobile website. 

With that said, it is increasingly best practice to make websites “responsive” to display different information 
for different devices.  “Mobile-first” websites can be designed around mobile the use-case with increased 
functionality for larger devices through frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap.

When necessary, website code can be leveraged to create a mobile app through technologies such as PhoneGap or
Titanium Appcelerator.  

Caveat: some businesses will require specific native app functionality; however, the list of native-only 
features is expected to decrease over time.
