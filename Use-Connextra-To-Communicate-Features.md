As a manager who is in charge of a software development team, it can often be difficult to accurately communicate a feature you want to include in your software. The manager will often not know the technical specifications of the feature to accurately portray it to the team. This problem can easily be overcome by using a connextra. This tool is effective because it provides information on the role of the user, a description of the feature the user wants to use, and the benefit the feature will provide to the user. The software developer is then able to better understand the reason for the feature, and then use his experience to find the best approach to build the feature.  

To provide more information on connextras, I have included below (1) the general format of a connextra, (2) a sample of a connextra, and (3) a link to more information about connextra.
