As a manager who is in charge of a software development team, it can often be difficult to accurately communicate a feature you want to include in your software. The manager will often not know the technical specifications of the feature to accurately portray it to the team. This problem can easily be overcome by using a connextra. This tool is effective because it provides information on the role of the user, a description of the feature the user wants to use, and the benefit the feature will provide to the user. The software developer is then able to better understand the reason for the feature, and then use his experience to find the best approach to build the feature.  

Alternatively, instead of connextra you could also use a Job Story to effectively communicate a feature to a software developer. The main difference with a job story is that you do not provide a role, but rather provide a story around the feature. After the story, you then provide the motivation and the expected outcome. This approach can be very helpful when it would be easier to explain the feature through a specific story, rather than a connextra.  

When building connextras, it is very important to not overwhelm your software development team by creating too many features. It is better to prioritize and add more features as they become finished to maintain morale. The connextras should also be discussed directly with the team and acquire a confirmation before they go up on the board to make sure everyone is aligned on its meaning. This approach will improve the likelihood of success.  

To provide more information on connextras, I have included below (1) the general format of a connextra, (2) a sample of a connextra, and (3) a link to more information about connextra.
