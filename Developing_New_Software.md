Most entrepreneurs first question is, “How much will it cost to develop software?”  However, there is far too much importance placed on developing software rather than growing the business with tools that already exist.  
Software development should be delayed because;
•	it is very expensive to create (you should avoid wasting your budget)
•	most ideas can be proven out by using other tools (e.g. email)
•	it locks the firm into software that it cannot easily change  
•	similar software usually exists that you can use to meet your business needs (e.g. Shopify)
•	software development often not the central to the success of most innovative business ideas.  
There are some cases where the software is vital to success, such as Uber, and should be created early in the life of the business but this is rare.  By delaying development entrepreneurs can give themselves the opportunity to develop their business, pivot if necessary and use their funds in the most effective way possible.
