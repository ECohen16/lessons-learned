I finally learned how to use trello through this class. 

Trello is a great tool for organizing to-do lists. It is popular among software developers. However, before taking this class, I always thought the interface was confusing and never got used to the UI.
But, when I learned how to apply Kanban system, it opened my eyes.

I am now organizing everything with trello by "to do", "doing", "done", "on hold" as in Kanban system
It is extremely useful tool in organizing to-do list and follow them up.

One mistake though is that I really fell in love with trello, I introduced it to my wife and 
I am even sharing some 'boards' with my wife...hmmm

But, you can always create more 'boards' to keep your privacy. Try it. It's a great product.
