As an executive who may not know much about software it is important to know the right questions and buzz words when hiring software developers. Generally speaking, you want to get a handle on how established they are within their field, their way of thinking about and organizing software, and weather of not they will be aligned with your mission.  

First, you want to determine how established the candidate is in the software field. To do this, start by attending software conferences. These conferences will provide insight into current developments and also provide access to top developers who are likely speaking at the conference. Ask people for references while you are there, this will be a great starting point to meet with people. While interviewing, ask questions like what projects did you previously work on, do you actively participate in GitHub, how many languages do you speak and which ones.  In order to test how many languages someone speaks you can always use the “fizz buzz” test, this test is very basic, but if they can write fix buzz in a language you can assume they know the language sufficiently enough. These questions will give you a good sense of how advanced the developer is in the field based on how easily they can answer these types of questions.

Next, based on what we have learned in this class, it is important to ask questions about how they think about organizing, writing, and testing software.  Asking questions like how they think about testing code prior to writing it is very important.  Additionally, what stories do they prefer (i.e. agile, scrum, kanban, etc) and how do they chose to manage these stories (i.e. Trello or post-it notes). These questions will give you an insight into how they manage software themselves and understand how effective they might be based on how much thought they have given these items.

Lastly, many developers have distinct personalities and really enjoy a certain quality of life. Part of having a developer dedicated to your software development is knowing that they are actively engaged and excited about what you are trying to do.  A classic example described in class was a software developer that was also in a band was very dedicated to helping build a new software that was music related. While that example may be on the extreme end of a perfect fit, it is important to find someone who is genuinely interested in what you are doing and advancing your business mission.

While the three things mentioned above are all really important from a software development standpoint, you should also consider the overall fit of the person’s character within your organization.  Fit questions for developer will be the same as fit questions with any other potentially employee, however, remember their communication skill are also extremely important.  Ask them to explain something technical to you to gauge how well they can break their trade down to laymen’s terms.
